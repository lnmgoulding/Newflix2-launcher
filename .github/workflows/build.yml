Hey Larry, Quick input needed :
Ask QuestionAgent will continue working after your reply

Now let's add the missing files. Go to your repo and:

    Click "Add file" → "Create new file"

    In the filename box, type exactly:

    .github/workflows/build.yml

    Paste this content:

name: Build APK

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Set up JDK 17
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'temurin'
    
    - name: Setup Android SDK
      uses: android-actions/setup-android@v3
    
    - name: Build Debug APK
      run: |
        chmod +x ./gradlew
        ./gradlew assembleDebug
    
    - name: Upload APK
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: newflix2-launcher
        path: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

  

Let me know when done, then we'll add the app/ folder files!
